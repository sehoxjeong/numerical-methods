    "In this section we cover **parallel computing** in Python. This means you will be able to run your code simultaneously on multiple cores on your CPU processors or increase the speed by taking advantage of the wasted CPU cycles while your program is waiting for external resources (e.g., downloading files, API calls, etc.). The fundamental idea of parallel computing is rooted in doing multiple tasks at the same time to reduce the running time of your program. The following figure illustrates the simple idea of doing parallel computing versus serial computing that we use so far."

Therefore, learning the basics of parallel computing will help you design code that is more efficient."

    "A **process** is an instance of a program (such as Python interpreter, Jupyter notebook, etc.). A process is created by the operating system to run program, and each process has its own memory block. A **thread** is a sub-process that reside within the process. Each process can have multiple threads, that these threads will share the same memory block within the process. Thus, for multiple threads in a process, due to the shared memory space, the variables or objects are all shared. If you change one variable in one thread, it will change for all the other threads. But things are different in different processes, changing one variable in one process will not change the one in other processes. Process and thread both have advantages or disadvantages, and can be used in different tasks to maximize the benefits."
